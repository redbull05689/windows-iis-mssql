<h2 id="feature">Feature of the Month:</h2>

<p>Experiment "Sign" button in PDF versions of Experiments.  Now you can click on the "Show PDF Version" of an Experiment, review this PDF version, and then directly sign this PDF version.  This eliminates the step of reviewing a PDF version of an Experiment, clicking on the "Experiment View" button, and returning to Experiment View to sign the Experiment.</p>

<h2 id="latest_news">New News:</h2>

<p>ArxLab recently unveiled a new user interface that highlights a clean design and modernized pages and dialogue boxes for functions such as logging in, creating new notebooks, and signing Experiments.  In the coming months, Arxspan will be implementing this new look and feel across the entire ArxLab interface.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Continued Search Enhancements:  The advanced search interface has a new look and feel; and after submitting any query (chemical structure, generic text, or advanced searches), the hits from your query will be returned more quickly.
<br/>

<li>
Audit Trails in Inventory:  In the Inventory record, for a container of material, there is tracking of who used the substance, when they used it, how much material they subtracted (or added), where the substance in the container came from, and where it has been used.

<h2 id="upcoming_enhancements">Upcoming Enhancements:</h2>

<ol>
<li>
In-line editing of documents in ArxLab Notebook:  Arxspan will introduce an in-line editor in ArxLab Notebook whereby live edits can be made to any document, including Excel, Word, image and text files, and analysis files such as Geneiousrx and GraphPad Prism, etc.  Any file that can be double-clicked and that is recognized and opened within your operating system can be edited live in the ArxLab Notebook.  This editor will be available for an additional fee.
</li>

<li>
Synthesis mapping: An optional new module available so that if you produce a compound in a reaction and then use this compound in a reaction as part of a separate Experiment, the system will ask you to trace back to the specific batch of that compound that was used for the reaction.
</li>

<li>
Inventory container integration with ArxLab Notebook: It will be possible to create a link in your Experiment that goes directly to a container in Inventory.  In the Inventory record there will be a link leading you to any Experiment where the substance in that container was used.
</li>

<li>
Registration integration with Inventory: A link in the details page for a substance in Registration will take you to the container in its location in Inventory.  At the same time, a link in the Inventory container takes you to the compound’s Registration information.
</li>

<li>
ArxLab Chinese localization: Arxspan will be releasing a Chinese localization of ArxLab Notebook.  If your browser’s preferred language is set to Chinese, this will take effect automatically when implemented.
</li>
</ol>
