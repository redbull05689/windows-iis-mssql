<h2 id="feature">Feature of the Month:</h2>

<p>The ArxLab suite of products uses an expanded CAS number lookups database.  Looking up a compound by CAS number in the ArxLab environment has become more dependable than ever in
the latest update.</p>


<h2 id="latest_news">New News:</h2>

<p>In order to support the increased use of the ArxLab suite in Japan, Arxspan is
proud to release the Japanese version of ArxLab.</p>

<h2 id="recent_enhancements">Recent Enhancements:</h2>

<ol>
<li>
In ArxLab Registration,
all data is validated as you submit it for an individual substance
registration.  Is your date a valid date?
Are numbers actually numbers?  Now these validation criteria are applied to
bulk uploads as well.  The ArxLab Registration system will inform you if any data in
your bulk registration is invalid.  Items
like ‘Scientist’ and ‘Project’ are also checked to be sure that they exist on
their respective lists and that the list items are normalized for capitalization
and punctuation.
</li>

<li>
Calculations in the stoichiometry grid have been
expanded, allowing you to make more calculations about yield, molarity, purity,
and other factors in your chemistry experiments.
</li>

<li>
Searching in the ArxLab
suite has been enhanced.  The advanced
search/query builder has a new look and feel, and once you have submitted a
query, results will be returned to you in a shorter time.
</li>

<li>
In ArxLab Assay,
module plates are now automatically updated with new solvent, sample, and total
volumes, as well as with new concentrations, when you daughter plates.
</li>

<li>
The ArxLab Inventory
and ArxLab Assay modules are now linked so that you
can work with a sample in Assay and then go right to Inventory to see where it
is, or move it to a new location.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="upcoming_enhancements">Upcoming Enhancements:</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Synthesis
Mapping: If someone produces benzene in a reaction and you then use this
benzene in a reaction as part of a separate experiment, the system will ask you
to trace back to the specific batch of benzene that you used for your reaction.
</li>

<li>
Inventory
Container Integration with ELN: It will be possible to create a link in your
experiments that goes directly to a container in Inventory.  In the Inventory record there will be a link
leading you to any experiments where the substance in that container was used.
</li>

<li>
Registration Integration
with Inventory: A link in the details page for a substance will take you to the
container in its location in Inventory. 
At the same time, a link in the Inventory container takes you to the
compound’s registration information.
</li>

<li>
Continued Search
Enhancements:  The advanced search interface
has a new look and feel; and after submitting any query (chemical structure,
generic text, or advanced), the hits from your query will be returned more
quickly.
</li>

<li>
Audit Trails in Inventory:  In the Inventory record, for a container of
material, there will be tracking of where the substance in the container came from and where it has been used.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips_and_tricks">Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<p>The ArxLab Notebook ELN
is rather unique as a web-based program in its ability to save an experiment
using the Ctrl-S shortcut.  There are
plenty of ‘save’ buttons available to you in an ELN experiment (‘1’ and ‘2’
below), but sometimes you might find yourself typing in one of the text
sections of an experiment, and using Ctrl-S may be more convenient.  If this is the case, you can save your work
with a keystroke instead of reaching away from your keyboard and finding your
mouse, just type ‘S’ while holding down the control key.  Note also that your work is saved as a ‘draft’
in your experiment’s history every few seconds (‘3’ below).
