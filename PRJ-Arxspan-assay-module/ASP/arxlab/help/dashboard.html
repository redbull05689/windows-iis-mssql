<h1>Dashboard</h1>
<p>The dashboard provides a centralized view of current Notebooks and alerts.</p>

<h2>My Notebooks</h2><p>
My Notebooks displays a list of Notebooks created and owned by you. You can access each notebook by clicking on the notebook name, which will take you to that <link>Notebook Summary<link>. To create a new Notebook from the Dashboard, simply click <a href="/arxlab/notebooks/create-notebook.asp">Create Notebook</a> at the top of the My Notebooks list.
</p>
<h2>Shared Notebooks</h2><p>
The Shared Notebooks list shows Notebooks created by other users and shared with you. To view a shared Notebook, click on the notebook name to see the <link>Notebook Summary<link>. Your access level to each shared Notebook will have been specified by the Notebook owner so you may or may not be able to view, create or share Notebooks that have been shared with you.
</p>
<h2>Invitations</h2><p>
<p>In order to gain access to a shared Notebook, you must be invited by the Notebook owner and you must accept the invitation. Invitations that you have received to share Notebooks that have not been accepted or declined are listed in the Invitations panel. Click on any Notebook name in the list to view the Invitation. Once a Notebook sharing invitation has been accepted, the Notebook will be listed in the Shared Notebooks list on your Dashboard.
</p>
<h2>Notifications</h2><p>
The Notifications panel lists recent activity taken by other users that impacts your Experiments or Notebooks. Notifications will appear for actions such as another user accepting or declining an invitation from you to share a Notebook, or when a witness request for a signed Experiment is confirmed or denied. Notifications are also used to announce scheduled maintenance windows for the ELN services.
