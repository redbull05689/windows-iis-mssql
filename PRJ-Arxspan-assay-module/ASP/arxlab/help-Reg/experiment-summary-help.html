<h2>Witnessing and Rejecting Experiments</h2>
<p>If you are chosen to witness an Experiment, you will receive a Notification on your Dashboard and the witness request will also appear in the left navigation bar of your ELN workspace. Click on the Experiment name and you will be brought to the Experiment page which will display a PDF of the completed Experiment. You also have access to the Experiment History to review any file attachments not rendered into the final PDF, etc. When you have reviewed the Experiment, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Witness or the Reject button.<p>

<p>When you witness an Experiment, a dialog box will appear. Enter your login and password information. Entering your password and clicking the check box indicates that you have reviewed the work in the Experiment. Click the Witness button. A dialog box will confirm that you have successfully witnessed the Experiment.<p>

<p>When you reject an Experiment, a dialog box will appear. You must enter a reason for rejecting the work as described. The reason for rejection will be entered into the Experiment History as a new Note and will be viewable by the owner of the Experiment. Click the Reject button. A dialog box will confirm that your rejection of the Experiment has been processed.<p>

<h2>Experiment History</h2>
<p>In the left navigation pane of the Experiment Summary page, you will see a section titled History. This History shows the audit trail of the Experiment. Specifically, a complete Version Control history of each Experiment that allows you to navigate back through each save point in the lifetime of the Experiment. There are several different icons to indicate the action that was taken at each save point, as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>	The atom icon indicates the creation of the Experiment. When you create a new Experiment from your <link>Notebook Summary<link> page, the new experiment is automatically named and saved in the Created state. Edits you make after creating the Experiment take place in the first revision of the Experiment history.

<li>	The floppy disk icon indicates that the Experiment was saved. A new entry is made in the History each time you click the Save button on the <link>Experiment Summary<link>, <link>Attachments Table<link> or <link>Notes Table<link>. The status of the Experiment is shown in the <link>Notebook Summary<link> as Saved.

<li>	The green single check mark icon indicates that the Experiment was electronically signed. A new entry is made in the History each time you click the Sign button on the <link>Experiment Summary<link>, <link>Attachments Table<link> or <link>Notes Table<link>. If the Experiment is left open after signing, its status in the <link>Notebook Smmary<link> is shown as Signed &mdash; Open. If the Experiment is closed, its status in the <link>Notebook Summary<link> is shown as Signed - Closed and it is rendered to PDF and submitted for witnessing. You always have access to Closed Experiments

<li>	The green double check mark icon indicates that the Experiment was electronically signed and witnessed by another person on your team. A new entry is made in the History when your Experiment is witnessed and its status in the <link>Notebook Summary<link> is shown as Witnessed. The Experiment, along with a PDF rendering of it, is stored in ArxLab's long term archive. You always have access to witnessed Experiments, but a witnessed Experiment cannot be edited.

<li>	The letter X icon indicates that your selected witness has rejected your signed and closed Experiment. When your Experiment is rejected, the witness must enter a Note explaining why the Experiment was rejected. Its status in the <link>Notebook Summary<link> is shown as Rejected and the Experiment is automatically re-opened and put into an editable state so that you can resolve any issues with it.
</ul>
<p>Clicking on any point in the History will display the complete state of the Experiment at the time it was saved, including any file Attachments and Notes. The point in the History that you are viewing is shown in bold face type for easy identification. Except when viewing the Current point in the History of an open Experiment, the Experiment contents will be displayed in a read-only state and cannot be edited.</p>

<p>To make a specific point in an Experiment's history editable, click the Copy button at the bottom of the Experiment to make a copy of the Experiment at that time. A dialog box will be shown. Select the Notebook in which you want the new Experiment to be created and click the Copy button. You will be taken to the new Experiment, which will contain a copy of all of the data from the History you made the copy from.</p>
