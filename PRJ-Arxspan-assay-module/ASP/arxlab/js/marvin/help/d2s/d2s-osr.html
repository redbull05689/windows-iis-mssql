  <h1>Configuring OSR tools for Document to Structure</h1>

The following instructions must be used to make sure Document to Structure can convert images to structures, using one
of the supported tools.

<h2>CLiDE</h2>

To use CLiDE with d2s, you need to obtain the
<a href="http://www.keymodule.co.uk/products/clide/clide-batch.html">CLiDE batch</a> product and a license from Keymodule.

<p>
On Windows 32 bit, CLiDE will be used automatically after installation, without further configuration.
On Windows 64 bit, you will need to set an environment variable named CLIDE to the installation directory of CLiDE,
typically <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Keymodule\Clide Batch</code>

<p>
On Linux and Mac OS X, you can install CLiDE batch to any directory. To make it usable by d2s, you should
only make sure that either clide-batch.sh is in your <code>$PATH</code>, or that you create a symbolic link from
<code>$HOME/.chemaxon/naming/clide-batch.sh</code>
to the installed copy of CLiDE, using this command: <pre>ln -s /&lt;clide-directory&gt;/clide-batch.sh $HOME/.chemaxon/naming/clide-batch.sh</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, on all platforms, if the <code>CLIDE</code> environment variable is set, it will be used
to find the CLiDE installation directory.

<p>
Please note that you need to activate your license before CLiDE works from d2s. Please follow the instructions provided by Keymodule
to do so.

<h2>OSRA</h2>

To use OSRA with d2s, you first need to
<a href="http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/osra/">download and install OSRA</a>.

<p>
On Windows, OSRA will be used automatically after installation, without further configuration.

<p>
On Linux and Mac OS X, you can install OSRA to any directory. To make it usable by d2s, you should
only make that the <code>osra</code> command is in your <code>$PATH</code>.

<p>
Alternatively, on all platforms, if the <code>OSRA</code> environment variable is set, it will be used
to find OSRA. The <code>OSRA</code> variable can either refer to the directory containing the <code>osra</code> command,
or to the command itself.

<h2>Imago</h2>

To use Imago, you need to <a href="http://ggasoftware.com/download/imago#commandline-utility-imagoconsole">download the command line utility</a> from GGA's website.
You should then unzip the downloaded file either to a directory on the <code>PATH</code>, or inside the ChemAxon naming directory:
<ul>
<li>On Windows: <code>C:\Users\&lt;USER&gt;\chemaxon\naming\imago_console.exe</code>
<li>On Linux and Mac OS X: <code>$HOME/.chemaxon/naming/imago_console</code>
</ul>

<p>
Alternatively, on all platforms, if the <code>IMAGO</code> environment variable is set, it will be used
to find Imago. The <code>IMAGO</code> variable can either refer to the directory containing the <code>imago_console</code> command,
or to the command itself.
