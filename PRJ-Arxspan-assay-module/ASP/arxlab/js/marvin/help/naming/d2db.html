  <h1>Document to Database</h1>

  <h2>Architecture</h2>
  <p>
  A typical system will consist of three server computers:
  <ul>
  <li>a document repository (Documentum)
  <li>a crawler (Document to Database)
  <li>a database server (for instance Oracle with the JChem cartridge)
  </ul>
  
<p>
The document repository is supposed to be existing and working. It is not needed when indexing documents from a filesystem.

<p>
The database server should also be already installed and running.

<p>
This documentation concerns the installation and setup of the crawler server.
It is recommended to dedicate a Linux machine for this task.
  </p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://shared.chemaxon.com/users/dbonniot/d2db-6.2.zip">d2db.zip</a>
<li>Log onto the crawler machine as the desired user.
<li><code>unzip d2db.zip</code>
<li><code>cd d2db</code>
<li><code>cp -a conf.sample conf</code>
</ol>

You are now ready to start the configuration.
  
  <h2>Configuration</h2>

The <code>conf</code> directory contains all configuration.
You need to edit at least the <code>d2db.conf</code> file, which contains
an example configuration and comments for each options.
You also need to edit <code>documentum/dfc.properties</code> with
documentum configuration (host, username and password).

  <h2>Commands</h2>
<p> 
Document to Database command-line actions all have the following form:
<p>
<code>./d2db d2db.conf &lt;command&gt; &lt;parameters...&gt;</code>

  <h2>Initialization</h2>

At this point you should be ready to run the first d2db command
to initialize the database. This will create the necessary tables.
Note that if you created the database schema yourself and only
want d2db to populate it, you should have used the
<code>d2db.fixedSchema = true</code> option and can skip this section.
<p>
To create the database tables, run this command once:
<p>
<code>./d2db d2db.conf create</code>

  <h2>Indexing</h2>

The <code>index</code> command should be used to tell d2db
which documents to index. For indexing a documentum folder, use:
<p>
<code>./d2db d2db.conf index documentum:&lt;folder&gt;</code>
<p>
For indexing a directory on a local or shared filesystem, use:
<p>
<code>./d2db d2db.conf index &lt;folder&gt;</code>

<p>
Note that d2db will automatically
detect documents that have already been indexed in a previous
run and have not been modified, in which case it will skip
over them quickly. This means that the index command can be used
both once for an initial indexing of a set of documents,
and also later to update the index (add new documents, remove
deleted documents, refresh modified documents). You can use the
<code>reindex</code> command to force reindexing all documents
even when they have not changed.
<p>
Once indexing has been done successfully, you might want to set up a cron job to run the index command
regularly.
