<h2><a class="anchor" NAME="superatom-sgroup">SuperatomSgroup</a></h2>

There are two states of the molecule:
 <li>All represented atoms are present in the parent molecule in all expandable 
  S-group independently from their expansion state.
 Here we can see a special S-group state called Sgroup.XSTATE_XC where the S-group remembers its previous contracted 
 state but the represented atoms were moved to the molecule graph and the abbreviation (SgroupAtom) was removed from the molecule
 graph. Set this state on all Sgroups by calling Molecule.setGUIContracted(false) or by calling 
 Sgroup.setGUIStateRecursively(false) individually on Sgroup-s. Example for a typical usage is a non-GUI related API
 based calculation where we need the represented atoms in the molecule graph instead of the abbreviation.
 </li>
 <li>Either the abbreviation (SuperAtom) or the represented atom set is exclusively present depending on the state of the S-group. 
In the case of expanded S-groups (called  Sgroup.XSTATE_X)  the represented  atoms are present in the parent molecule. 
In the case of contracted S-groups (called  Sgroup.XSTATE_C)  the abbreviation ( SgroupAtom) is present in the parent 
 molecule. Set this state on all Sgroups by calling Molecule.setGUIContracted(true) or by calling 
Sgroup.setGUIStateRecursively(true) individually on Sgroup-s.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>
Note:
 </br>
When Molecule.isGUIContracted() returns true and afterwards you call:
</br>
<code>
Molecule.setGUIContracted(false);
</br>
Molecule.setGUIContracted(true);
</code>
</br>
the second <code>setGUIContracted</code> call will restore the state before the first <code>setGUIContracted</code> call!
